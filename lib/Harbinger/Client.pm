     server => 'foo.lan.bar.com',

 $client->send($doom->finish);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

After reading
L<The Mature Optimization Handbook|http://carlos.bueno.org/optimization/mature-optimization.pdf>,
in a fever dream of hubris, I wrote C<Harbinger::Client> and
L<Harbinger::Server|https://github.com/frioux/Harbinger>.  They have both
served me surprisingly well with how minimal they are.  The goal is to be as
lightweight as possible such that the measuring of performance does not degrade
performance nor impact reliability.  If the client B<ever> throws an exception
I have failed in my goals.

As should be clear in the L</SYNOPSIS> the grim measurement that the
C<Harbinger> records is called L</DOOM ðŸ’€>.  L</DOOM ðŸ’€> currently measures a handful
of data points, but the important bits are:

=over 2

=item * time

=item * space

=item * queries

=back

See more in L</DOOM ðŸ’€>.

=head3 METHODS

=head3 C<new>

Instantiate client with this method.  Note example in L</SYNOPSIS>.

Takes a hash of C<harbinger_ip> (default of C<127.0.0.1>), C<harbinger_port>
(default of C<8001>), and C<default_args> (default of C<[]>).

C<harbinger_ip> and C<harbinger_port> are how to connect to the remote
C<HarBinger::Server>.

C<default_args> get used in L</start> and L</instant> when forging new L</DOOM ðŸ’€>.

=head3 C<start>

The typical way to start measuring some L</DOOM ðŸ’€>.  Note example in L</SYNOPSIS>.

Actual implementation at L<< /Harbinger::Client::Doom->start >>.

=head3 C<instant>

 $client->instant(
    ident => 'man overboard',
    count => 1,
 );

Instead of measuring deltas as L</DOOM ðŸ’€> typically does, this method is for measuring
instantaneous events, maybe for counting or graphing them later.  Sends the
event immediately.

=head3 C<send>

 $client->send($completed_doom);

Once L</DOOM ðŸ’€> is ready to be sent to the server pass it to C<send>.

=head1 LIGHTHOUSE â›¯

Beware the siren song (ðŸ‘„) of the B<Harbinger>!  The API is not stable yet, I already
have major changes planned for a plugin (ðŸ”Œ) system.  I'm not even going to attempt
to keep things working.  You've been warned (âš ).

=head1 DOOM ðŸ’€

Measure the crushing weight, the glacial pace, the incredible demand which your
application puts upon your database server with C<DOOMâ„¢>

=head2 DOOMFUL ATTRIBUTES â˜ 

=head3 C<server>

Something unique that identifies the machine that we are measuring the L</DOOM ðŸ’€>
for.  A good idea is the ip address or the hostname.  If this is not set L</DOOM ðŸ’€>
will not be sent or recorded.

=head3 C<ident>

Something unique that identifies the task that we are measuring the L</DOOM ðŸ’€> for.
For a web server, C<PATH_INFO> might be a good option, or for some kind of
message queue the task type would be a good option.

=head3 C<pid>

The pid of the process L</DOOM ðŸ’€> is being recorded for.  Has a sensible default,
you probably will never need to set it.

=head3 C<port>

The port that the service is listening on, if applicable.  Leave alone if
unknown or not applicable.

=head3 C<count>

The count of things being done in this unit of L</DOOM ðŸ’€>.  If it were a web
request that returns a list of items, this would reasonably be set as that
number.  If the operation is not related to things that are countable, leave
alone.

=head3 C<milliseconds_elapsed>

The total milliseconds elapsed during the unit of L</DOOM ðŸ’€>.  If instant or
unknown L</DOOM ðŸ’€> leave empty.

=head3 C<db_query_count>

The total queries executed during the unit of L</DOOM ðŸ’€>.  If not applicable or
unknown L</DOOM ðŸ’€> leave empty.

=head3 C<memory_growth_in_kb>

The total memory growth in kb during the unit of L</DOOM ðŸ’€>.  If not applicable or
unknown L</DOOM ðŸ’€> leave empty.

=head3 C<query_logger>

A tool to measure query count with C<DBIx::Class>.  Please only use as
documented, underlying implementation may change.  See L</QUERYLOG ðŸ“œ>

=head2 DOOMFUL METHODS ðŸ”®

=head3 C<< Harbinger::Client::Doom->start >>

Normally called via L</start>.  Sets up some internal stuff to make automatic
measuring of L</memory_growth_in_kb> and L</milliseconds_elapsed> work.  Takes a
hash and merges hash into the object via accessors.

B<NOTE>: to automatically measure memory growth you need either
L<Win32::Process::Memory> or L<Proc::ProcessTable> installed.

=head3 C<< $doom->bode_ill >>

Increment the L</DOOM ðŸ’€> L</count>er.

=head3 C<< $doom->finish >>

 $doom->finish( count => 32 );

Finalizes L</memory_growth_in_kb> and L</milliseconds_elapsed>.  As with
L<< /Harbinger::Client::Doom->start >> takes a hash and merges it into the object
via accessors.  Returns the object to allow chaining.

=head1 C<Plack::Middleware::Harbinger>

 builder {
   enable Harbinger => {
      harbinger_ip   => '192.168.1.1',
      harbinger_port => 2250,
      default_args   => [
         server => '192.168.1.2',
         port   => 80,
      ],
   };
   $my_app
 };

Takes the same args as L</new>.  Adds C<query_log> from L</DOOM ðŸ’€> to
C<harbinger.querylog> in C<psgi ENV>.  See L</QUERYLOG ðŸ“œ>.

After the query completes the L</DOOM ðŸ’€> will automatically be sent.

If C<harbinger.ident> is set it will be used for the L</ident>, otherwise
C<PATH_INFO> will be used.

C<harbinger.server>, and C<harbinger.count> are passed more or less directly.

C<harbinger.port> will be passed if true, otherwise C<SERVER_PORT> will be used.

=head1 C<Catalyst::TraitFor::Controller::Harbinger>

This page intentionally left blank.

=head1 QUERYLOG ðŸ“œ

You are recommended to apply the query log with L<DBIx::Class::QueryLog::Tee>
and L<DBIx::Class::QueryLog::Conditional>.

First, set up your schema
 package MyApp::Schema;

 use base 'DBIx::Class::Schema';
 use aliased 'DBIx::Class::QueryLog::Tee';
 use aliased 'DBIx::Class::QueryLog::Conditional';

 __PACKAGE__->load_namespaces(
    default_resultset_class => 'ResultSet',
 );

 sub connection {
    my $self = shift;

    my $ret = $self->next::method(@_);

    $ret->storage->debugobj(
       Tee->new(
          loggers => {
             original => Conditional->new(
                logger => $self->storage->debugobj,
                enabled_method => sub { $ENV{DBIC_TRACE} },
             ),
          },
       )
    );

    $ret->storage->debug(1);

    $ret
 }

 1;

Note that the L<DBIx::Class::QueryLog::Tee> extension allows you to add more
Query loggers as you go, so you can even log inner loops and outer loops at the
same time.  Also note that L<DBIx::Class::QueryLog::Conditional> allows you to
have the C<Harbinger> loggers always on, but the pretty L<DBIx::Class> console
logger can still be set via environment variable, as usual.

Now to set the logger after whipping up some L</DOOM ðŸ’€> this is all that's needed:

 my $doom = $client->start(
    ident => 'process-images',
 );

 $schema->storage->debugobj
   ->add_logger('process-images-harbinger', $doom->query_logger);

 $client->send($doom->finish);
 $schema->storage->debugobj
   ->remove_logger('process-images-harbinger');

Finally, if you have some legacy code or are using the wrong ORM, you can still
use the QueryLogger as follows:

 $dbh->{Callbacks}{ChildCallbacks}{execute} = sub {
   $doom->query_log->query_start('', []);
   $doom->query_log->query_end('', []);
   return ();
 }

If you can pull it off, doing this dynamically with C<local> is preferred, but
that's not always possible.
